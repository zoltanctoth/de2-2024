### **Part 1. Preamble, Regions, Availability Zones (AZ), Edge Locations**

Cloud computing allows users to quickly access vast amounts of computing resources remotely, without the need to purchase or maintain hardware. There are many cloud providers offering these services; this lecture focuses on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The fundamental concepts we discuss, however, apply broadly to other providers, such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, though the terminology may differ between platforms.

### Glossary and Abbreviations

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** - A collection of cloud computing services provided by Amazon.
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** - AWS service that provides resizable cloud hosting, allowing you to configure and rent virtual machines on an as-needed basis.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Storage)** - Persistent storage solution that integrates with EC2. EBS volumes are generally SSD-backed, providing reliable storage that can only be attached to a single EC2 instance at any given time.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** - Cost-effective, large-scale storage solution. Unlike EBS, which allows direct attachment as a local drive, S3 stores data as objects accessed via an API or command-line interface. While suitable for massive datasets, S3 may have certain limitations compared to EBS, such as latency.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)** - A type of fast, reliable storage hardware generally more expensive than traditional hard drives.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** - Traditional, spinning-disk storage, offering large capacity at lower cost, but with slower performance compared to SSDs.
- **Ephemeral Storage (Instance Store Storage)** - Temporary, local storage for EC2 instances that is wiped once the instance is stopped or terminated. Instance stores may use either SSD or HDD hardware.

## Regions

An **AWS Region** is a physical location worldwide, consisting of multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Each region operates independently to reduce latency and increase redundancy.

**Current AWS Regions and their identifiers:**

- **US East**
  - North Virginia - `us-east-1`
  - Ohio - `us-east-2`
- **US West**
  - Northern California - `us-west-1`
  - Oregon - `us-west-2`
- **Canada**
  - Central - `ca-central-1`
- **Europe**
  - Frankfurt - `eu-central-1`
  - Ireland - `eu-west-1`
  - London - `eu-west-2`
  - Paris - `eu-west-3`
- **Asia Pacific**
  - Tokyo - `ap-northeast-1`
  - Seoul - `ap-northeast-2`
  - Osaka-Local - `ap-northeast-3`
  - Singapore - `ap-southeast-1`
  - Sydney - `ap-southeast-2`
  - Mumbai - `ap-south-1`
- **South America**
  - São Paulo - `sa-east-1`

## Availability Zones (AZ)

**Availability Zones (AZs)** are distinct data centers within a region, each with independent power, networking, and connectivity to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Distributing applications across multiple AZs provides redundancy and minimizes latency.

**Regions with Multiple Availability Zones:**

- **US East**
  - Ohio (3)
  - North Virginia (6)
- **US West**
  - Oregon (3)
  - Northern California (3)
- **Canada**
  - Central (3)
- **South America**
  - São Paulo (3)
- **Europe**
  - Ireland (3)
  - Frankfurt (3)
  - London (3)
  - Paris (3)
- **Asia Pacific**
  - Singapore (3)
  - Seoul (2)
  - Tokyo (4)
  - Mumbai (2)
  - Sydney (3)
  - Beijing (2)
  - Ningxia (2)

Deploying across multiple AZs within a region is crucial for fault tolerance and performance, as this setup reduces the risk of downtime due to individual data center failures.

1. **Fault Tolerance**: By spreading workloads across multiple AZs, an application is protected from single-point failures. If one data center (or AZ) experiences issues, such as a power failure or network outage, the application can continue running in the other AZs. This setup helps prevent complete service disruptions and improves the application's resilience.

2. **Improved Performance and Reduced Latency**: Traffic can be directed to the closest or least-busy AZ, minimizing latency and balancing the load more effectively. Even if one AZ is experiencing heavy traffic, users in other AZs will still receive a responsive experience.

3. **Disaster Recovery**: A multi-AZ deployment supports business continuity planning by providing redundancy in geographically dispersed locations, making it easier to recover from localized disasters and continue operations smoothly.

For cloud-based applications, this redundancy and performance optimization ensures a high level of availability, aligning with best practices for a reliable and resilient cloud infrastructure.

## Edge Locations

**AWS Edge Locations** are geographically dispersed locations designed to cache content, enhance user experience, and reduce latency by bringing data closer to users. This is especially useful for services like AWS CloudFront and AWS CDN. For instance, if you host a website on AWS, images and other media files can be cached at multiple edge locations around the world. This setup ensures that each user’s request for an image is fulfilled from the server closest to them, significantly reducing load times and improving performance.

Each AWS region has its own set of **Availability Zones** and **Edge Locations**, which can even be located in countries that don’t have a full AWS region or availability zone. You can think of Edge Locations as independent data centers that serve cached data, making them a strategic asset for content delivery.

## Part 2: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**Amazon S3** is a secure, durable, and highly scalable storage service. It allows you to store and retrieve unlimited amounts of data from anywhere on the internet. S3 is object-based, which means data is stored as objects within *buckets* (like folders for organizing files).

### Key Features of S3:
- **Object-based Storage**: Each object can be up to 5TB in size.
- **Components of an Object**:
  - **Key**: Name of the object.
  - **Value**: Data itself (a sequence of bits).
  - **Version ID**: For versioning, allowing multiple versions of a file.
  - **Metadata**: Data about the data, such as creator or last modified date.
  - **Subresources**: Access control lists, torrent links, etc.
- **Unlimited Storage**: S3 has no limit on the amount of data you can store.
- **Buckets**: The container for objects; each bucket must have a unique name globally and is accessible via a unique web address.
- **Successful Uploads**: A successful file upload returns an HTTP 200 status code.

AWS S3’s scalable and flexible nature makes it ideal for storing static assets, backups, data for applications, and more.

[Video 2 - S3 Netflix Demo](https://youtu.be/06AQA3xXXLA)

## Data Consistency for S3

### Consistency Models in S3
- **Read-After-Write Consistency for PUTS of New Objects**: 
  When a new object is uploaded to S3, you can read it immediately after uploading—this is known as “read-after-write” consistency. For example, when you use a `PUT` request to add a file, it’s immediately accessible.

- **Eventual Consistency for Overwrite PUTS and DELETES**: 
  For updates or deletions of existing objects, S3 follows an eventual consistency model. This means that if you modify or delete an object and attempt to read it right away, you might still get the previous version until changes propagate fully across the S3 system.

### S3 Guarantees
- **Availability**: S3 is built for **99.99% availability**.
- **Durability**: Amazon guarantees **99.999999999% durability** (11 nines) for data stored in S3.

## S3 Features Overview

- **Tiered Storage Options**: Different storage classes for various access needs.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Policies for automatic data migration across storage classes.
- **Versioning**: Maintains multiple versions of objects, helping with recovery.
- **Encryption**: Data can be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Secure your data using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies.

## Setting Up a Security Group and Launching an EC2 Instance

Before launching and using an EC2 instance, ensure that you create a Security Group to control inbound and outbound traffic. Follow the steps below to set this up.

### Step 1: Navigate to Security Groups

1. After logging in, go to **Services** > **EC2** > **Security Groups**.


### Step 2: Create a Security Group

1. Click **Create Security Group**.
   
   - **Note**: When you create an Inbound rule, an Outbound rule is created automatically. You can leave the Outbound rule empty, as Security Groups are stateful. If you allow traffic in (e.g., HTTP), it is automatically allowed out.

2. Set up rules for HTTP and SSH protocols:

   - **HTTP**  
     - IPv4: `0.0.0.0/0`
     - IPv6: `::/0`
   - **SSH**  
     - IPv4: `0.0.0.0/0`
     - IPv6: `::/0`

   ![](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/fdea9e7d0967703547364da30986b644/97808/sec-rules.png)

3. After creation, you should see two HTTP rules and two SSH rules displayed:

   - **HTTP**: `0.0.0.0/0` (IPv4) and `::/0` (IPv6)
   - **SSH**: `0.0.0.0/0` (IPv4) and `::/0` (IPv6)

4. For this course, you will need to open **port 8787 (TCP)** to allow SSH access to your instances. 

   - **Note**: Any changes made to a Security Group take effect immediately.

### Attaching the Security Group to an EC2 Instance

1. You can attach more than one Security Group to an EC2 instance if needed.
2. Once your Security Group is created, proceed to create your EC2 instance.
3. After the instance is launched, attach the Security Group by navigating to:
   - **Instances** > **Select your EC2 Instance** > **Actions** > **Networking** > **Change Security Groups**
   - Select the Security Group you created and assign it to your EC2 instance.

1. To begin, go to the list of AWS services and select **EC2**.

    ![List of AWS services (select EC2 for this tutorial):] (https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/e4c5fc6c69613eed076ac53878f31fcc/ffe34/AWS-Services.png)

2. The EC2 Dashboard provides access to your instances, settings, and monitoring tools.

   ![The AWS EC2 dashboard:](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/f8b04228d942a2240224661db7a28eed/beade/AWS-EC2-Dashboard.png)

# Understanding AWS Regions and Cost Structure

## What is a Region?

An AWS Region is a set of compute resources that Amazon maintains, similar to a data center. Each Region corresponds to a physical warehouse of compute hardware, including computers, storage, networking, etc. 

### Current AWS Regions

As of now, there are **eight** AWS Regions:
- **US East (N. Virginia)**
- **US West (Oregon)**
- **US West (N. California)**
- **EU (Ireland)**
- **EU (Frankfurt)**
- **Asia Pacific (Singapore)**
- **Asia Pacific (Tokyo)**
- **Asia Pacific (Sydney)**
- **South America (São Paulo)**

![AWS Regions Map](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1.png)

### Importance of Choosing the Right Region

When logged into the AWS EC2 console, you are always operating in one of these eight regions. The current region is displayed in the upper right corner of the console, between the User menu and the Support menu.

**Why is this important?**
1. **Instance Visibility**: When you launch an EC2 instance, it is created in a specific region. If you switch regions, you won’t see that instance unless you return to the original region.
2. **Resource Tracking**: The same applies to EBS volumes, AMIs, and other resources—they are region-specific.
3. **Cost Variation**: The cost to use AWS resources can vary by region.
4. **Network Performance**: The geographical location of the region can affect network performance, especially when transferring large amounts of data.

**Example**: If you are in the US and uploading RNA-seq data, it may not make sense to create instances in Asia Pacific (Sydney). Ideally, choose a region that is close to you or your users, while also considering costs.

### AWS EC2 Regions Menu

## How Much Does It Cost to Use AWS EC2 Resources?

Estimating costs for AWS resources can be complex. Generally, when you launch an EC2 instance or create an EBS or S3 volume, you are renting that resource and will be charged as long as it is reserved, regardless of actual usage.

### Example Scenario

- **Resource**: 8-core machine with 1TB of disk and 64GB of RAM.
- **Billing**: You will incur hourly charges as long as the machine is running, even if you don't log in or use it.

### Key Pricing Categories

To understand costs better, refer to the AWS EC2 Pricing list. Important categories include:
- **Free Tier**: Lightweight resources for free experimentation.
- **On-Demand Instances**: Rent by the hour.
- **Reserved Instances**: Discounts for longer-term rentals.
- **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused capacity in an open market.
- **EBS-Optimized Instances**: For high-performance file I/O.
- **Amazon Elastic Block Store**: Rent storage volumes separately from instances.

### Monthly Cost Estimation

Amazon provides a [Monthly Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to help predict costs.

### Examining On-Demand Pricing

In this section, we’ll look closely at the On-Demand instance pricing. For example, let’s consider the **m3.xlarge** instance type in the **US West (Oregon)** region:

- **CPUs**: 4
- **Memory**: 15 GiB
- **Storage**: 2 x 80GB SSD drives
- **Cost**: $0.140 per hour

![EC2 Pricing Table Example](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/75105c6d2a2c169a8129b17272eec1b8/f79fa/AWS-EC2-PriceList.png)

**Note on Terminology**:
- **GiB vs. GB**: Memory is reported in GiB and storage in GB (1 GiB ≈ 1.074 GB).
- **vCPUs and ECUs**: 
  - **vCPU**: Virtual CPU that represents the number of physical CPUs available.
  - **ECU**: Elastic Compute Unit, which allows for comparisons between machines with different CPU generations.

### Storage Types

Storage descriptions for EC2 instances include:
- **EBS only**: Volumes that exist independently of EC2 instances and can be attached to multiple instances.
- **SSD**: Solid-state drive, typically higher performance.
- **HDD**: Hard disk drive, generally less expensive but lower performance.

When an instance has a designation like **2 x 40 SSD**, it means there are two solid-state drives, each 40GB in size. The SSD and HDD drives associated with instances are considered **ephemeral** storage.

# Understanding AWS Billing

## How Does Billing Work?

AWS provides an accounting of usage and costs on a **30-day cycle**. You can access detailed information about your account in the **Billing and Cost Management** section of the User menu in the EC2 console. Additionally, the [EC2 FAQ page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/) has a dedicated billing section for more information.

### Key Billing Principles

Amazon describes the billing process as follows:
- You pay **only for what you use**, with **no minimum fee**.
- Pricing is calculated per **instance-hour** consumed for each instance type.
- **Partial instance-hours** are billed as full hours.
- There is **no Data Transfer charge** between two Amazon Web Services within the same region.
- Data transferred between AWS services in different regions is charged as **Internet Data Transfer** on both sides of the transfer.
- Usage for other AWS services is billed separately from Amazon EC2.
- **Billing begins** when EC2 initiates the boot sequence of an AMI instance and ends when the instance terminates (via command, shutdown, or failure).
- **Instance-hours** are billed while instances are in a **“running” state**. To stop incurring charges, you must **stop** or **terminate** the instance.

### Complexity of Billing

Although it sounds straightforward, AWS billing can become complex:
- **EBS usage** is billed separately from EC2 resources, despite their close relationship.
- For example, the root volume on a Linux instance often exists as an EBS volume, incurring charges whether the system is running or stopped.
- Extra EBS volumes attached to an EC2 instance also incur costs, even when the instance is stopped.
- When an instance is terminated, associated EBS volumes may or may not be automatically destroyed, depending on how the instance was configured.
- Creating a **Snapshot** of your instance saves it to EBS storage, which incurs charges as long as it exists. Creating an **AMI** (Amazon Machine Image) also stores a Snapshot.

### Cost Calculation

The total cost for an EC2 instance is calculated as follows:
- **Hourly Rate** from the pricing list × **Number of Hours** the instance was running (rounded up to the closest whole hour).

In the **Billing and Cost Management** section of the EC2 console, you can set up billing alerts to notify you of ongoing costs.

### Checking for Unintended Charges

If you notice a monthly fee without intentionally using resources, follow these steps:
1. Log into the **AWS EC2 console**.
2. Check for the following in each AWS Region:
   - **Running Instances**
   - **Volumes**
   - **Elastic IPs**
   - **Snapshots**

If any of these values are greater than 0, you may be billed for resources Amazon is reserving for you. Terminating or deleting these items should bring your monthly bill back to **\$0**.

## Necessary Steps for Launching an Instance

In the following sections, we will launch an example instance, configure it in the AWS EC2 console, and discuss important configuration concepts. We will also log into the instance once it is running.

### Launching a Virtual Server

1. Make sure you are logged into AWS and navigate to the **EC2 dashboard**.
2. Click the **Launch Instance** button.
3. Choose to run a virtual server with the latest stable version of the **Ubuntu** operating system.
4. Decide on the basic hardware specifications for your server.
5. Configure storage, security, and other necessary settings.

### Example Instance Launch

In this example, we will launch an instance in **EU West (Ireland)**. Make sure to pick the closest region to your location.

![](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/6f341d8e02e674ffc9ae015f7883b822/ba168/az-eu-west.png)

# Launching an Instance

Please make sure to select **EU West (Ireland)**.

## Step 1: Choosing an AMI

An **AMI** (Amazon Machine Image) is a template for launching an instance. 

The AMI includes:
- A pre-configured root volume that contains an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu Linux, Windows, etc.).
- Basic configuration of storage volumes available within an instance.

The first step to launching an instance is to select an AMI. Refer to the screenshot below.

### AMI Selection Options
There are four main options when selecting an AMI:
1. **Quick Start**: A short list of basic systems chosen by Amazon as common starting points, with some degree of "official" support and testing on AWS.
2. **My AMIs**: AMIs you have created yourself, possibly using a Quick Start or Community AMI as a starting point. For example, you might start with an Ubuntu AMI, install necessary bioinformatics software, and save this configured machine as an AMI to share a complete system configuration.
3. **AWS Marketplace**: AMIs configured for certain applications by companies (often software companies). You can browse through this section to get an idea of the kinds of applications available.
4. **Community AMIs**: Thousands of AMIs created by users worldwide. These AMIs are region-specific, so ensure you search in the correct region.

For this tutorial, we will select an AMI from the **My AMIs** list: 
- The full-length description for this AMI is **Ubuntu - CEU - SSH on 8787**.
- The Root device type is **EBS** and the Virtualization type is **HVM**.

The root volume of the operating system will be installed on an EBS volume, which means information stored will persist if we stop the instance. 

Once you are ready to proceed, press the **Select** button.

![Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/91f73005cf7257c893a370523bd86e12/1e496/AMI-aws.png)

---

## Step 2: Choosing an Instance Type

Once an AMI is selected, the next step is to choose an instance type. 

In simple terms, we decided on the operating system we want to run, and now we need to choose the hardware that it will run on.

### Instance Type Selection
In the example, we have selected **General purpose** in the dropdown filter and picked **t2.nano** Instance Type. Note that the price per hour for each of these options is not listed here. To get the price, note the instance type name (e.g., t2.nano) and refer back to the EC2 pricing list.

We are given a series of options that differ in their number of CPUs, memory, pre-configured storage, and network performance. You can adjust this table using the **Show/Hide Columns** option.

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Next: Configure Instance Details** button.

![Step 2: Choose an Instance Type](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/cded756d12d31b27c7b3267f958c590f/38116/ec2nano.png)

---

## Step 3: Configuring Instance Details

Once an instance type is selected, the next step is to configure the instance details. 

This step introduces many advanced concepts that will be covered only briefly here. For the most part, leaving all of these options at their default value will be fine.

### Instance Configuration Options
Using the **Number of instances** option, you could launch multiple instances of the same AMI with the same hardware configurations at the same time. However, in our example, only one instance will be launched.

- You can attempt to negotiate a cheaper rental by using the **Request Spot Instances** option.
- The **Shutdown behavior** option determines what will happen if you shutdown the instance from within the AMI (e.g., by issuing a `sudo shutdown` command in Linux).
- To prevent accidental termination of your instance, you may want to set this option to **Stop**.
- You can also enable **termination protection** to help prevent accidental termination.

These options can be adjusted later for any instance in the console.

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Next: Add Storage** button.

![Step 3: Configure Instance Details](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/4fb38bbefc39cdeaaa7ea1cc813180c5/63908/AWS-EC2-ConfigureInstanceDetails.png)

---

## Step 4: Adding Storage

The next step is to configure the disk/storage that will be available in the instance.

The starting point of this page depends on the instance type selected in Step 2. Remember that we selected an instance type with an EBS root volume during AMI selection. 

### Storage Configuration
The first volume is **8 GiB**. This is the root volume where the operating system will exist. It is set to be deleted on termination of the instance, but you could choose to keep it as well. 

- Choose **EBS** as the Type, set the device to `/dev/sdc`, give it a size of **500 GiB**, and set the volume type to **General Purpose (SSD)**.

Now, when we log into the instance, we will expect to find two distinct storage volumes/devices.

### Storage Options Comparison
- **EBS (Elastic Block Storage)**: 
  - Can be linked to a single instance.
  - Can persist even if the instance is destroyed.
  - Useful for writing analysis results to retain them after instance shutdown.

- **Instance Store Volumes**: 
  - Considered 'ephemeral' or transient; data is unrecoverable if the machine is stopped or terminated.
  - Can only be configured when the instance is created.

### Root Device Type
The Root device type refers to the type of volume used to store the operating system itself. This is usually a small volume (often 8 GiB) that can be either EBS or Instance Store type. 

Once you launch the AMI, you cannot change the Root device type. The **Instance Store** type may have a performance advantage, but the **EBS** type is more flexible and safer from the perspective of accidental data loss.

For beginners, we recommend using EBS for the root device type. 

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Next: Tag Instance** button.

![Step 4a: Add Storage](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/b867080c4ace54155563cd51b21c67f7/84bc0/S3StorageRevised.png)

![This is how you add additional storage](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/4bffb08c6b05028dbbf51fa7858187dd/900ee/AWS-EC2-AddStorage2.png)
---

## Step 5: Tagging the Instance

As you start to have a large number of instances running or saved, you may want to start assigning Tags to help track their usage and billing details. 

Try creating a Tag as a simple key/value pair. 

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Next: Configure Security Group** button.

![Step 5: Tag Instance](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/4ac8c99ed1b9bc3b51097de1c8f70ee7/913a1/ec2-tags.png)

---

## Step 6: Configuring a Security Group

A **Security Group** controls how services and users can access your instance once it is running. 

When you launch a new instance, you can choose to configure a new Security Group and use it or select one that you created previously. You can also select a default security group.

### Security Group Settings
The purpose of Security Group settings is to determine what Inbound and Outbound network traffic will be allowed on the instance. It is highly recommended that most incoming traffic be blocked, allowing only certain services on an as-needed basis.

For example, create a Security Group called **CEU-Tutorial** that only allows incoming traffic of two types:
- **SSH** (over port 22)
- **HTTP** (over port 80)

You can restrict access to certain IP addresses for enhanced security.

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Review and Launch** button.

![Step 6: Configure Security Group](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/e25fd5190ac9a8ae8e7898c7a11ff76c/6578c/Security-Group-AWS.png)

---

## Step 7: Reviewing the Instance before Launch

At this stage, you will be presented with a final summary describing the configuration of your instance. Some warnings may appear, especially if you have allowed broad incoming access.

Once you are ready, proceed to the next step by pressing the **Launch** button.

![Step 7: Review Instance Launch](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/3b8992582517b2c61bff9e5c25f4257b/ce0a7/Review-AWS.png)

---

## Step 8: Assigning a Key Pair

You will now be presented with the important configuration step: assigning a **Key Pair**. 

A Key Pair consists of two keys: a public key stored in AWS and a private key presented to you upon creation, which you must save to log into your instance later.

If this is your first instance, you will have to create a new key pair. 

Once you choose a name (e.g., **AWS-Tutorial**), press the **Download Key Pair** button. This will download a `.pem` file that you need to store securely on your computer.

The contents of an RSA key file should look something like this:

```bash
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

If this is not your first instance and you have already created a key pair, you can choose to use the existing key pair.

![Select an existing Key Pair or create a new Key Pair:](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/3574efc8295c3f6f7fa5c1dfc2258906/de755/keypair-aws.png)

To prepare for logging into your instance, create a directory on your local computer and store the key file there. Here’s how to do it on a Mac:

```bash
mkdir ~/CEU-Tutorial
mv ~/Downloads/CEU-Tutorial.pem ~/CEU-Tutorial
cd ~/CEU-Tutorial
chmod 400 CEU-Tutorial.pem 
ls
```

Explanation of Commands:
-mkdir ~/CEU-Tutorial: Creates a new directory named "CEU-Tutorial" in your home directory.
-mv ~/Downloads/CEU-Tutorial.pem ~/CEU-Tutorial: Moves the downloaded Key Pair file into the newly created directory.
-cd ~/CEU-Tutorial: Changes the current directory to "CEU-Tutorial".
-chmod 400 CEU-Tutorial.pem: Changes the file permissions of your key file to ensure that only you can read it. This is a critical security measure; if you attempt to log into your instance with incorrect permissions on your key file, your login will fail.

## Step 9: Reviewing Launch Status

Once you have launched your instance, you will be presented with a review page. This page will summarize the key settings and configurations for your new EC2 instance. When you are ready, proceed to the next step by clicking the **View Instances** button.

![Step 9. Review launch status:](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/38eddaf787871174a814caf88ddc7589/647f4/AWS-EC2-LaunchStatus.png)
---

## Step 10: Examining a New Instance in the EC2 Console

You should now see the EC2 Console displaying a new instance. This view shows a table of all instances you have created in the current region. 

### Key Points to Note:

- **Instance Visibility**: When an instance is terminated, it will remain visible in this table for a brief period before being automatically removed.
- **Instance Status**: After a few minutes, your instance should achieve an **Instance State** of "running."

### Information Overview

The EC2 console provides a wealth of information, both in the table and in the detailed description view below. Familiarize yourself with the following key attributes:

- **Name**: The name you've given to your instance.
- **Instance Type**: The type of instance you have configured (e.g., t2.micro).
- **AMI ID**: The Amazon Machine Image ID used for launching the instance.
- **Root Device Type**: The type of storage (e.g., EBS).
- **Block Devices**: The storage volumes associated with your instance.

To effectively manage your instances, pay attention to the following items:

- **Instance State**: Indicates whether your instance is running, stopped, etc.
- **Key Pair Name**: The name of the key pair associated with the instance.
- **Security Groups**: The security settings applied to your instance.
- **Public IP / Public DNS**: The IP address or DNS name used to connect to your instance.

### Instance Management

To modify an instance in the EC2 console:

1. **Select the Instance**: Use the blue checkboxes to select the instance(s) you want to modify.
2. **Actions Menu**: Perform various tasks using the **Actions** menu. You can also right-click on a single instance to obtain a similar menu.

Before logging into your instance, take a moment to explore various important sections of the EC2 console, particularly:

- **EC2 Dashboard**
- **Volumes**
- **Security Groups**
- **Key Pairs**

### Example: Console View of a New Instance

*Please do not replicate this instance here.*
![Step 10. EXAMPLE! Console view of a new Instance (Please don't replicate this instance here)](https://ceu-cloud-class.github.io/static/b74dfb4fb2bc34fa0ebee898fbb1233d/b85c3/AWS-EC2-Console.png)

**Check**

-The EC2 dashboard should now show a running Instance, Volumes, etc.
-Review new Volumes
-Review new Security Groups
-Review new Key Pairs
---

## Step 11: Connecting to Your Instance Using SSH

You've started your instance, but how do you access it? If you're not familiar with SSH (Secure Shell), it's a command-line protocol that allows you to log into a computer remotely over the network. In simple terms, it lets you use a computer that isn't physically in front of you.

### Getting Ready to Log In

1. **Open Terminal**: Launch a terminal session on your local computer (using Mac Terminal or Windows PuTTY).
2. **Navigate to Key File Location**: Change directories to where you stored your key file, `CEU-Tutorial.pem`.

    ```bash
    cd ~/CEU-Tutorial
    ```

3. **Set Permissions**: Ensure that the permissions of your key file are set correctly. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 CEU-Tutorial.pem
    ```

    Setting permissions correctly is essential; otherwise, you may face login issues due to bad permissions.

### Verify Instance Information

Simultaneously, view your instance in the EC2 console:

- **Check Key Pair Name**: Make sure that the Key Pair Name for this instance matches the `.pem` key file you have.
- **Obtain Public IP**: Get the Public IP value from the console to use it for the SSH command. You can also use the Public DNS value if preferred.

### Logging In

To log in to your instance, check this tutorial: [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html)

If successful, you will see something like this:

```bash
       __|  __|_  )
       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI
      ___|\___|___|

https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/...
```
Reflections on the above tutorial
In this example, we open a terminal command line session on our local computer. We moved to the location of my `.pem` key file. We then made sure the permissions of this file were set correctly using a `chmod` command. You only need to do this step once but there is no harm in doing it again. Then we executed an SSH command to remotely log into our AWS instance using the `Public IP`. Our SSH command included an option to use the `.pem` file to identify us as the owner of the instance. We logged into the instance as a user called `name` as an example now that is a user that we know will be defined by default on all systems.

Pitfall: One thing to watch out for is the following: the ssh address is based on your IP address and if you start and stop your instance the IP can change, changing the address you ssh into along with it (again, the value in the field Public DNS). If you've re-started your instance and are having trouble sshing, check that your address is correct.

## Step 12: Install NGINX

Now that we are in, let's set up NGINX:
1. **Update the OS**: Run the following command to apply all updates to your operating system:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
2. Install NGINX: To install NGINX, run:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```
3. Navigate to HTML Folder: You will now have an HTML folder. Change to the directory
```bash
cd /var/www/html
```
4. List Contents: List the contents of the directory:
```bash
ls
```
   You should see one .html file.
5. Edit the HTML File: Use your preferred text editor (e.g., Nano, Vim, Emacs) to make some changes to the HTML file. For example, with Nano:
```bash   
nano index.html
 ```   
6. View Changes: Now you will see the changes if you visit your website.
      
 ## What is the difference between the 'Start', 'Stop', 'Reboot', and 'Terminate' (Instance States)?

From the AWS EC2 console, you can change the state of each of your instances:

- The **Start** command will boot a system that has been powered down.
  
- The **Stop** command will power down the instance and is similar to performing a shutdown from within the instance (if you have configured your instance that way during creation). Do not forget that if you stop an instance with ephemeral Instance Store volumes, the contents of these volumes will be lost.

- The **Reboot** command will simply reboot the machine. This is equivalent to using a reboot command from within the instance.

- The **Terminate** command will destroy the instance and any ephemeral Instance Store volumes associated with it. If the root device is an EBS volume it may or may not be destroyed depending on how you configured the instance during creation. If there were additional EBS volumes associated with the instance and you terminate the instance, these may also be destroyed if you selected that option when they were being created. Before terminating an instance, you should think carefully about whether there is data you want to save and if so, how the volumes will behave on termination. Similarly, if you want to destroy all components of an instance, including all associated volumes, you may need to terminate the instance and then separately destroy certain volumes.

## Tidying up and shutting down AWS resources

Once you are done with this tutorial, you should terminate or delete all resources that were created to ensure you are not charged. Specifically, you should remove:
- Instances
- Volumes
- Snapshots

You may also decide to remove other entities that were created for demonstration purposes, including:
- Tags
- AMIs
- Security Groups
- Key Pairs

All of this can be done in the AWS EC2 console. When you are all done, the EC2 Dashboard should show 0 for all resource types except Security Groups, where a single default security configuration will remain.

## Further reading (Optional)

This is a basic introduction to AWS cloud computing that assumes all configuration of the instance will occur within the AWS EC2 console of your web browser and all configuration of the Ubuntu Linux system will occur by the user manually executing commands and perhaps saving the outcome as a custom AMI. For large-scale computing and complex deployments of compute infrastructure on the cloud, these methods will not be sustainable.

Here is a list of more advanced topics for discussion on how to move beyond the console and automate configuration of your system:
- Use of the AWS command line interface (CLI)
- Use of the AWS EC2 API
- Use of AWS SDKs
- Use of S3 and Glacier
- Use of Vagrant to launch AWS instances
- Use of Puppet to configure Linux systems

### What is S3 and what does it mean?

**Answer**: S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. S3 is object storage with a simple web interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

---

### What are some usages of S3?

**Answer**: You can use Amazon S3:
- As primary storage for cloud-native applications
- As a bulk repository, or "data lake," for analytics
- As a target for backup and recovery and disaster recovery
- With serverless computing.

---

### What are the features of S3?

**Answer**: 9 features:
- **Simple**: Easy-to-use web-based management console + REST API
- **Durable**: Your data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities and multiple devices in each facility
- **Scalable**: You can store as much data as you want and access it when needed.
- **Secure**: Amazon S3 supports data transfer over SSL and automatic encryption of your data once it is uploaded. You can also configure bucket policies to manage object permissions and control access to your data using IAM
- **Available**: Designed for up to 99.99\% availability of objects over a given year and is backed by the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement, ensuring that you can rely on it when needed.
- **Low cost**: Using lifecycle policies, you can set policies to automatically migrate your data to Standard - Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier as it ages to further reduce costs
- **Simple data transfer**: Amazon provides multiple options for cloud data migration and makes it simple and cost-effective for you to move large volumes of data into or out of Amazon S3. You can choose from network-optimized, physical disk-based, or third-party connector methods for import to or export from Amazon S3
- **Integrated**: Amazon S3 is deeply integrated with other AWS services to make it easier to build solutions that use a range of AWS services
- **Easy to manage**: Amazon S3 Storage Management features allow you to take a data-driven approach to storage optimization, data security, and management efficiency. These enterprise-class capabilities give you data about your data, so you can manage your storage based on that personalized metadata.

### What is AWS EC2?

**Answer**: EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. It is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

---

### What is a region?

**Answer**: A Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

---

### What is an Availability Zone?

**Answer**: AZs consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

---

### What is an Edge Location?

**Answer**: Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. There are many more Edge Locations than Regions. Currently, there are over 96 Edge Locations.

---

### What is the difference between a region, an Availability Zone, and an Edge Location?

**Answer**:
- A region is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more Availability Zones.
- An AZ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
- Edge locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content.

---

### What is the root account?

**Answer**: This is the email address used to sign up for AWS. It provides unlimited access to do things in the cloud.

---

### Which permissions do new users have when created?

**Answer**: New users have NO permissions when first created.

---

### What is the difference between access keys and user/pass?

**Answer**: You cannot use the Access Key ID and Secret Key to log in to the console. You can use these to access AWS via the APIs and CLI, however.

---

### What is the size of the files on S3?

**Answer**: From 0 Bytes to 5 TB.

---

### What is the data consistency model for S3?

**Answer**:
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate).

---

### What are the different Tiers/Classes of storage for S3?

**Answer**:
- **S3 Standard**: 99.99\% availability, 99.999999999\% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently. No retrieval fees.
  
- **S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed)**: For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.

- **S3 One Zone - IA**: A lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple AZ data resilience.

- **Glacier**: Very cheap, but used for archival only. Options: 
  - Expedited (higher fees, less retrieval time -- within minutes)
  - Standard (3-5 hours)
  - Bulk (5-12 hours).

---

### What are the S3 charges?

**Answer**: Charged for:
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing (the tags you use on your data, added on the metadata of your files)
- Data Transfer Pricing (when you transfer data from one region to another)
- Transfer Acceleration
